What is Knocked
###################

Knocked is a custom starter project for developing single page applications. It is powered by CodeIgniter v3.0.3 and KnockoutJS v3.3.0

###################
What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

###################
What is KnockoutJS
###################

Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model.
Any time you have sections of UI that update dynamically (e.g., changing depending on the userâ€™s actions or when an external data source changes),
KO can help you implement it more simply and maintainably.
